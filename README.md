# COMMUTE: A Comparative Analysis of MPC-based Models for Urban Traffic Environments
A git repo containing all sumo and python codes used for our CoE 199 group's capstone project, COMMUTE

## GIT GUIDE

An issue with the multiple code revisions is keeping track of changes, which is very hard to do if we just send updated codes. Hence, the use of git.
This guide was copied from Smartlight group's github repo.

The repository is already reorganized so that the changes we make with the codes are reflected only in a single source.

Steps: \
0. Have Git installed
1. Clone the Repository
    Once repository is cloned, open the directory on your IDE.
2. Whenever you make changes to the files in the repo do the following:
    git add .
    git commit -m "insert message here, describe the changes you are making"
    git push
